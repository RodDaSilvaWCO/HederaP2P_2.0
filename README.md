# HederaP2P 2.0
Hedera24 Hello Future 2.0 Hackathon Repo

Welcome to the HederP2P 2.0 submission repo readme for the Hedera 24 Hello Future 2.0 Hacathon Repo.   This repo contains only the source code that was added to the broader UnoSys decentralized operating project which is not open source and is not provided here.  All changes to the UnoSys code base for this hackathon were net new additions and all such additions have been included here.

Please see this video link for an explanation of the project and demonstrations of the software that is being submitted:

Please use this link to download the software itself (it was too big to be placed on GitHub).  As its P2P software you must download it and run it locally.  This isn't the "web" anymore.

# NOTES
The above video link show a comprehensive demos of what has been added to the HederaP2P (1.0) hackathon submission for the Hedera 24 Hello Future (1.0) Hackathon.  You can find the original submission here (https://github.com/RodDaSilvaWCO/HederaP2P).  

The entire demo shown in the video can be reproduce yourself on a Windows 10+ machine immediatley after downloading the software.  For instructions on how to use the simulator please watch the video and/or run WCSim ? for help.

[Please note that the WorldComputer "node" software (WCNode.exe) is designed to be cross-platform and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux.  However, the WorldCOmputer Simulator (WCSim.exe) written for the v1.0 Hackathon submission and extended for this submission will only run on a Windows machine at this time.  Therefore the demo as a whole is currently only reproducible on a Windows machine.] 

I would like to once again give a shout out to Jason Fabritz for his awesome Hashgraph .NET SDK product which I used once more (I have used it in the last three Hedera hackathons as well) to integrate UnoSys (which is entirely written in .NET) with the Hedera.  Its an excellent piece of work and Hedera should take a serious look at supporting it and the .NET developer community (6 million strong) more completely.

If you are interested in learning more about UnoSys or the broader World Computer Project that it is apart of, there is more information included whitepapers to be found at www.WorldComputer.org.

Finally, I can be reached at RodDaSilva@WorldComputer.org if there are any questions.

Have fun!
